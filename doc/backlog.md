Project backlog
===============

This is where we'll document all the requirements and features that we are implementing or about to implement. If there's something you want to add or do, just add it as an entry. 

Week3
-----

* Random patterns
    - *Juha*
    - Input: Maximum and minimun throw height
	- Input: Number of balls
	- Something mathematically interesting we'll go through on Tue 5.5. lecture
	- *Otto* and *Markus*
	- Non-uniform random patterns (geometric randomness)


* An actual program meant for execution
	- Main.py
	- Define the intercafes (in code) between the objects

* Visualization/Graphics
	- *Tatu*
	- Support for multiple simultaneous throws
	- Color coding
	- More flexible wiev
	- Two hands
	

* Buffer for enabling virual pattern visualization
	- *Markus*
	- Buffer object

* GUI *Otto*
	- Input: max and min height, number of balls
	- something else?

* Documentation
	- *Vikram*
	- Exgtensive commenting
	- Code review

The future
----------

* Configuration files for graphics settings

* Adding more (non-anti) particles to a pattern
	- State.addparticle() might be a good way?
